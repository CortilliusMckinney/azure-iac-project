# Azure Infrastructure High-Level Design

## Overview
This document describes the overall architecture of our Azure infrastructure implemented using Terraform. Our infrastructure follows a modular, multi-environment design focusing on security, scalability, and maintainability.

## Core Infrastructure Components

### State Management
- Azure Storage Account for Terraform state
- State file locking for team collaboration
- Encrypted state storage
- Access controlled through Azure AD

### Networking Layer (modules/networking)
- Virtual Network per environment
- Subnet segregation for different workloads
- Network Security Groups for access control
- Service endpoints for Azure services

### Security Layer (modules/security)
- Azure Key Vault for secrets management
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Network security policies
- Resource encryption

### Compute Resources (modules/compute)
- Virtual Machines for application hosting
- Environment-specific sizing
- Managed disks for storage
- Integration with networking and security

### Storage Layer (modules/storage)
- Azure Storage Accounts
- Blob containers for application data
- Secure access configuration
- Data redundancy options

## Environment Strategy

### Development Environment
- Reduced redundancy for cost savings
- Relaxed security for easier development
- Minimal resource allocation

### Staging Environment
- Production-like configuration
- Full security implementation
- Moderate resource allocation

### Production Environment
- High availability configuration
- Strict security controls
- Optimized resource allocation

## Security Architecture
1. Network Security
   - NSGs on all subnets
   - Deny-all default rules
   - Limited internet exposure

2. Access Control
   - Managed Identities where possible
   - RBAC for resource access
   - Just-in-time VM access

3. Data Protection
   - Encryption at rest
   - Encryption in transit
   - Key Vault integration

## Deployment Strategy
- Infrastructure as Code using Terraform
- GitOps workflow through GitHub Actions
- Environment-specific configurations
- Automated validation and testing

## Testing Strategy
Our infrastructure follows a progressive testing approach:

### Module Testing
- Individual module validation
- Cross-module integration testing
- Security compliance verification

### Environment Testing
- Development environment testing for basic functionality
- Staging environment testing for production parity
- Production environment testing for enterprise requirements

### CI/CD Integration
- Automated testing through GitHub Actions
- Progressive test activation per component
- Comprehensive validation before deployment
