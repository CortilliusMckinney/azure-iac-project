# Azure Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Project 🚀

## 📋 Project Overview
In modern cloud environments, manually creating and managing infrastructure is time-consuming and error-prone. This project demonstrates enterprise-grade Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices using Terraform with Azure.

## 🏗️ Architecture
Our project implements a modular, multi-environment infrastructure:

```

## 🛠️ Prerequisites
- VS Code with extensions:
  - HashiCorp Terraform
  - Azure Terraform
  - GitLens
- Azure CLI installed and configured
- Terraform installed
- Git for version control

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Initial Setup
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone [repository-url]
cd azure-iac-project

# Login to Azure
az login

# Initialize Terraform
terraform init
```

### 2. Backend Configuration
```bash
# Navigate to backend configuration
cd backend-config
terraform init
terraform apply

# Configure state storage
STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME=$(terraform output -raw storage_account_name)
```

### 3. Environment Deployment
```bash
# Deploy to development
cd environments/dev
terraform init
terraform apply

# Follow similar steps for staging and production
```
